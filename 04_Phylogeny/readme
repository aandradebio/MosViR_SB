## Get taxonomy information for representative sequences

1. **Prepare Accession Numbers:** Ensure you have a file named `accession_numbers.txt` containing the list of accession numbers you want to process.

2. **Generate Script:** Run the following command in your terminal to generate the script to retrieve taxonomic information for each accession number:
   
   ```bash
   while read line; do echo "./getTax.sh ${line}" >> run.sh; done < accession_numbers.txt

3. **Set Permissions and run**
   ```bash
   chmod 777 *sh
   ./run.sh

This script automates the retrieval of taxonomic information for the provided accession numbers. It calls the getTax.sh script for each accession number, passing it as an argument. The getTax.sh script utilizes the Entrez Direct utilities (esearch and efetch) to fetch taxonomic information from NCBI databases.
The getTax.sh script generates a CSV file named taxonomic_info2.csv, which contains the following information for each accession number:

    Accession number
    Taxonomic ID (Taxid)
    Lineage
    Scientific Name

The taxonomy information was used to annotate the Itool Trees.
